The clamour of the excited spectators gradually fades behind you as you venture deep into the gloom of the cavern tunnel.
Large crystals hang from the tunnel roof at twenty-metre intervals, radiating a soft light, just enough for you to see your way.
As your eyes gradually become accustomed to the near darkness, you begin to see movement all around. 
Spiders and beetles crawling up and down the chiselled walls disappear quickly into cracks and crevices as they sense your approach; rats and mice scurry along the floor ahead of you. 
Droplets of water drip into small pools with an eerie plopping sound which echoes down the tunnel. The air is cold, moist and dank. 
After walking slowly along the tunnel for about five minutes, you arrive at a stone table standing against the wall to your left. On it there are six boxes, one of which has your name painted on its lid.

If you wish to open the box, type 1.
If you prefer to continue walking north, type 2.
<2>
The Scorpion manages to hold you in its pincers long enough to flick its segmented tail forward over its head and sting you with its poisonous barb. 
The effect is fatal and you slump to the ground in the Arena of Death, wondering whether Throm will win through.
<3>
The Gnome shakes his head and says, "I am afraid you have failed the Trial of Champions. Baron Sukumvit's Deathtrap Dungeon will keep its secrets for another year, you will not be allowed to leave here. 
You are appointed my servant for the rest of your days, to prepare and modify the dungeon for future contestants. Perhaps in another life you will succeed...'
<4>
In the total darkness you do not see the pipe's downward turn. You slip and, unable to get a grip on the slimy pipe, slide over the edge.
Your screams echo down the pipe as you fall the fifty metres to the bottom. You have failed the Trial of Champions.
<5>
You crawl along the floor and find yourself in the lair of a tribe of TROGLODYTES. As you creep past them, your scabbard bangs against a rock on the floor. 
TEST YOUR LUCK
<6>
Knowing that the Manticore will fire the spikes in its tail at you, you run for cover behind one of the pillars.
Before you reach it, a volley of spikes flies through the air and one of them sinks into your arm. 
Lose 2 STAMINA points. If you are still alive, you waste no time and attack the Manticore with your sword before it has time to unleash more of its deadly spikes.
MANTICORE	Skill 11	Stamina 11
<7>
Before you have time to reach a doorway, the boulder is upon you. 
You cry out in pain and terror as it crushes you to the floor. 
Your adventure ends here. 
<8>
The Mirror Demon grabs you by the wrist. Immediately it starts to pull you towards the mirror. 
Its strength is incredible, and, despite all your efforts, you cannot prevent it from pulling you relentlessly towards the mirror. 
When it touches the mirror, it seems to disappear straight through it. With horror you see your own arm disappear, 
followed by the rest of your body. You are now in a mirror world of another dimension, from which you can never return. 
<9>
The Hobgoblins have nothing of any use to you on them, so you decide to open the bag on the floor. 
Inside you find a corked earthenware jug. You uncork it and sniff the liquid inside. It smells sharp and acrid. 
If you wish to drink some of the liquid, type 1. 
If you wish to dip a piece of cloth in it, type 2. 
<10>
Still running as fast as you can, you reach into your backpack and pull out the wooden tube. 
You plan to lie under the surface of the water, breathing through the tube. With luck, the Troglodytes will assume that you will be swept to your death downriver as the torrent disappears into the depths of the mountain. 
You seize the tube between your teeth and lower yourself into the water. Holding on to one of the underwater bridge pillars, you keep perfectly still for ten minutes. 
When you finally think the Troglodytes have gone, you rise to the surface and look around. 
There is nobody to be seen, so you climb out of the river and cross the bridge to the northern bank. Any remaining Provisions you may have are now sodden and inedible. 
You continue to walk through the vast cavern until at last you see a tunnel in the far wall. 
You walk down it until you come to a heavy wooden door, which is locked. 
If you have an iron key, you can open it.
<11>
You look down and see the crumpled bodies of the Flying Guardians lying motionless on the floor.
You start to prise out the idol's emerald eye with the tip of your sword. At last it comes free, and you are surprised by its weight. 
Hoping that it may be of use later, you put it in your backpack. 
If you now wish to prise out the right eye, type 1.
If you would rather climb down the idol, type 2. 
<12>
The door opens into a large, candle-lit room filled with the most extraordinarily lifelike statues of knights and warriors. 
A white-haired old man dressed in tattered rags suddenly jumps out from behind one of the statues and starts to giggle. 
Though he looks like a fool, the sparkle in his eyes makes you think there is more to him than is apparent. 
In a high-pitched voice he says, 'Oh good, another stone for my garden. I'm glad you have come to join your friends.
Now, I'm a fair man and so I'll ask you a question. If you answer correctly, I'll let you go free - but if your answer is wrong, I'll turn you to stone!' 
He starts to chuckle again, obviously pleased with your arrival. Will you:
Wait for his question? Press 1
Attack him with your sword? Press 2
Make a run for the door? Press 3 
<13>
The tunnel makes a sudden turn to the left and heads north for as far as you can see. The footprints you are following start to peter out 
as the tunnel becomes gradually drier. Soon you are beyond the dripping roof and the pools on the floor. 
You notice the air becoming hotter and you find yourself panting even though you are walking quite slowly. 
In a small recess on the left-hand wall you see a section of bamboo standing on its end. 
Lifting it down, you see it is filled w1th a clear liquid. Your throat is painfully dry and you feel a little dizzy from the heat in the tunnel.
If you wish to drink the liquid, type 1.
If you do not want to risk drinking the liquid and would rather continue north, type 2.
<14>
The tunnel leads into a dark chamber covered in thick cobwebs. Clawing your way through them, you trip over a wooden casket. 
If you wish to try to open the casket, type 1.
If you would rather continue north, type 2.
<15>
A tickling sensation runs down your spine as you crawl carefully out of the room. Back in the tunnel you heave a sigh of relief, throw the skull back into the room and slam the door shut.
Pleased with your good fortune, you set off west once again.
<16>
You just have time to hear the Gnome say, 'Three skulls' before a white bolt of energy shoots out from the lock into your chest, knocking you unconscious.
If you are still alive, you come to and are told by the Gnome to try again. You chose the wrong gems last time, so you won't try that combination again.

1) Emerald		Diamond		Sapphire	
2) Diamond		Sapphire	Emerald	
3) Sapphire		Emerald		Diamond	
4) Emerald		Sapphire	Diamond	
5) Diamond		Emerald		Sapphire
6) Sapphire		Diamond		Emerald	
<17>
You are not strong enough to force open the heavy door. The water is now waist-high and you are exhausted from your efforts.
The water level rises quickly and you find yourself floating ever upwards until your face is pressed against the ceiling. 
You are soon completely immersed and unable to hold your breath any longer. Your adventure ends here.
<18>
Luckily for you, the cobra's fangs sink into your leather wristband. The snake recoils quickly, ready to strike again,
as the Dwarf tells you to have another try.
Roll two dice and see if the total is greater than your skill, or less than/equal to your skill.
<19>
You cannot resist the Medusa's beguiling gaze as she looks into your eyes. You feel your limbs begin to stiffen and you panic helplessly as you turn to stone.
Your adventure ends here.
<20>
Only your incredible strength could withstand the poisonous spider's bite. However, you are weakened and you notice your hand trembling as you pocket the Gold Piece.
Your SKILL is reduced by 1 point. You curse the person who dropped the backpack and set off north again.
<21>
The wound has had no effect on the Bloodbeast, and it continues to attack you as furiously as before.
Continue your combat and as soon as you win your next Attack Round, TEST YOUR LUCK.
<22>
Although you are slightly uneasy in each other's company, knowing that there can only be one winner in the Trial of Champions, 
you are both content to share in the benefits of a temporary alliance. You begin to tell each other of your exploits so far, of the monsters and traps encountered and the dangers overcome. 
Walking along, you soon come to the edge of a wide pit. It is too deep and dark to see the bottom. The Barbarian offers to lower you to the
bottom with his rope, saying he has a torch which he can light for you to use. Will you:
Accept the Barbarian's offer? Type 1
Offer to lower him down if he is so eager to investigate the pit? Type 2
Suggest that you both jump over the pit instead? Type 3 
<23>
The paper bears a simple warning written in dried blood: "Beware the Trialmasters'.
You replace the paper on its nail and run back down the tunnel to rejoin the Barbarian.
<24>
Set back in an arched alcove in the tunnel wall you see an ornate wooden chair carved in the shape of a demon-like bird of prey.
If you wish to sit in the chair, type 1.
If you would rather keep going north, type 2.
<25>
Although the temperature in the tunnel is higher than you could normally tolerate, the liquid from the bamboo pipe keeps you alive.
<26>
The pill makes you feel dull and lethargic. Lose two SKILL points.
The Dwarf tells you that you can now progress to the second stage of the test. He reaches for a wicker basket and tells you that there is a snake inside it.
He tips up the basket and the snake drops on to the floor; it is a cobra and it rears up into the air ready to strike. 
The Dwarf says he wants to test your reactions. You must grasp the cobra bare-handed below its head, avoiding its deadly fangs.
You crouch down on the floor, tensing yourself for the moment at which to seize it.
Roll 2 dice, and compare to your Skill.
<27>
You step up to the frightened man and cleave the chain with your sword. He drops to his knees and bows, thanking you over and over again.
He tells you that four years ago he entered the Trial of Champions but failed. 
He fell down a pit and had to be rescued by a Trialmaster, one of Baron Sukumvit's dungeon administrators.
He was offered a choice between death or servitude in Deathtrap Dungeon as the Trialmaster's minion.
Choosing the latter, he worked like a slave until he could stand it no longer and tried to escape.
Alas, he was unsuccessful and was captured by the Trialmaster's wandering Orc guards.
To teach him a lesson, they cut off his hand and condemned him to a year's imprisonment in this cell. 
You ask him whether he has any information that might be of use to you. He scratches his head. 'Well, I haven't exactly done very well in here myself,'
he says, 'but I do know that you need to collect gems and precious stones if you hope to get out. I don't know why, but there it is.'
Without another word, the ragged prisoner dashes out of the room, turning left into the tunnel.
You decide to keep heading north and turn right into the tunnel.
<28>
The Dwarf's chainmail coat is of finest-quality iron, obviously made by a master armourer. You strip it from his body and place it over your head.
Add 1 Skill point. There is nothing else of use to you in the chamber, so you decide to investigate the new tunnel.
<29>
The tunnel leads north for some distance before coming to a dead end. The mouth of a chute protrudes from the tunnel's eastern wall.
It seems to be the only way out. You decide to risk it and climb into the chute. You slide gently down and come out in a room, landing on your back.
<30>
Taking a step forward, you leap towards the far edge of the pit.
TEST YOUR LUCK
<31>
The Gnome smiles and says, 'Good. Now, have you a sapphire in your possession?"
<32>
You soon come to another junction in the tunnel. One branch leads east, but the wet footprints you have been following continue north and you decide to follow their trail.
<33>
It was a mistake to reach into the hole with your sword arm. It is covered with round sucker marks and feels as if it has been crushed.
Lose 3 SKILL points.
You peer into the hole and see the bleeding tentacle stump hanging limply. You carefully pull out the grappling iron and leather pouch, in which you find a tiny brass bell.
You pack away your new possessions and head north.
<34>
You try to force the point of your sword under the emerald eye. Much to your surprise, the emerald shatters on contact, releasing a jet of poisonous gas straight into your face.
The gas knocks you out and you release the rope, bounce down the idol and crash on to the stone floor. Your adventure ends here.
<35>
The tunnel continues west for several hundred metres, finally ending at some steps leading up to a closed trapdoor. You climb the steps slowly, hearing muffled voices above you. 
In the dim light you can see that the trapdoor is not locked.
If you wish to knock on the trapdoor, type 1.
If you wish to burst through the trapdoor with your sword drawn, type 2.
<36>
You run faster than you have ever run in your life before, but still the boulder is catching up on you.
Roll two dice. See if the total is the same as or less than both of your SKILL and STAMINA scores.
<37>
The passage opens out into a wide cavern which is darker but much drier. Ahead you see the footprints gradually fade, then disappear.
There is a large idol in the centre of the cavern, standing approximately six metres high.
It has jewelled eyes, each as big as your fist. There are two giant stuffed bird-like creatures standing on either side of the idol.
If you wish to climb the idol to take the jewels, type 1.
If you wish to walk through the cavern to the tunnel in the opposite wall, type 2.
<38>
The man stands by silently while you gulp the water and wolf down the bread. A sharp pain grips your stomach and you fall to your knees.
The old man looks at you scornfully and says, 'Well, if you will eat poisoned food, what do you expect?'
Lose 3 STAMINA points.
He shuffles off, leaving you writhing in pain on the floor. If you are still alive, you eventually regain enough of your strength to continue west.
<39>
You manage to evade the outstreteched legs of the diving Giant Fly. Stepping back, you draw your sword and prepare to fight the hideous insect as it turns to attack you again.
GIANT FLY	Skill 7		Stamina 8
You may Escape by running back into the tunnel to head north.
<40>
You call out to the Dwarf that you are ready to fight the MINOTAUR.
The wooden door rises slowly and you see the fearsome beast, half man, half bull, step into the arena.
Steam blows from its nostrils as it works itself up into a rage, ready to attack.
Suddenly it russhes forward, swinging its double-headed axe.
MINOTAUR	Skill 9		Stamina 9
<41>
You walk slowly over to the alcove, carefully checking the floor for any more hidden traps. You see that the goblet contains a sparkling red liquid.
Will you:
Drink the red liquid? Type 1
Leave the goblet and walk back to search the Barbarian (if you have not done so already)? Type 2
Leave the chamber to continue west?	Type 3
<42>
The cobra's fangs sink deep into your wrist and you feel its poison starting to creep through your body.
Lose 5 STAMINA points.
If you are still alive, the Dwarf has no mercy but tells you to try again.
Roll two dice and see if it is greater than your Skill.
<43>
The tunnel turns sharply to the right and continues north for as far as you can see. There is a door in the left-hand wall which is ajar.
You hear someone cry for help from the other side of the door. 
If you wish to open it, type 1.
If you would rather continue north, type 2.
<44>
You are only a few metres from the doorway when you hear the old man behind you utter some strange words.
Instantly your muscles harden and you feel your skin becoming taut. You start to panic, but there is nothing you can do to stop the petrifaction of your body.
Your adventure ends here.
<45>
The razor-sharp disc thuds into your back with terrible effect. 
Lose 1 SKILL and 4 STAMINA points.
If you are still alive, you struggle to pull the disc from your back as the Ninja throws yet another one at you.
<46>
You lower yourself carefully down the idol and, wasting no more time in the cavern, run forward to the tunnel in the northern wall.
<47>
Have you got a hollow wooden tube?
<48>
Only your immense strength and grim determination keep you from falling unconscious to the floor. 
You grit your teeth and press on resolutely.
<49>
You peep round the corner and see two small creatures running away from you. Both are dressed in baggy clothes and wear pointed floppy hats.
They are mischievous LEPRECHAUNS.
If you wish to follow them, type 1.
If you would rather walk back to the last junction to head north, type 2.
<50>
You wake to find Throm pulling the ring off your finger. He puts it on the floor and crushes it with the head of his battleaxe.
Then, grunting to show his disapproval of you, he strides off east. You stand up slowly and stagger off after him.
<51>
The Hobgoblins are unprepared for your attack, and you are able to kill the first one before he can draw his sword.
You turn to face the remaining Hobgoblin, who snarls at you with hatred.
HOBGOBLIN	Skill 6		Stamina 5
<52>
As you open the book, it begins to disintegrate and the pages turn to dust in your hands. You manage to keep a few fragments and read the handwritten script.
The book appears to be about monsters, and from what you can make out it contains a full description of a monster called the Bloodbeast.
It is a horrific bloated creature with tough, spiny skin and facial blisters which burst open to become mock eyes,
evolved to hid the Bloodbeast's only weak spot - its real eyes. Bloodbeasts usually dwell in pools of fetid slime which give off a poisonous gas.
This gas is so strong that it can easily knock people unconscious.
The Bloodbeast, although too bulbous to haul itself out of its slime pool, has a long and vicious tongue which it wraps around its victims before it drags them into its pool. 
As the victim's flesh starts to decompose int he vile slime, the Bloodbeast will feed from it.
You tell Throm about the grotesque Bloodbeast, but he merely shrugs his shoulders and tells you to get going. 
If you have not done so alread, you may open the black book. Type 1.
Otherwise you must continue north with Throm. Type 2.
<53>
The Bloodbeast is too bulbous to climb out of its pool, but its long tongue whips out and tries to wrap itself around your leg.
Fortunately, you have fallen beyond its reach. The air at ground level does not contain any of the poisonous fumes, but you wake with a pain in your throat.
You cover your mouth with your sleeve so that you can breathe through it, and decide what to do.
If you wish to run around the pool towards the tunnel, type 1.
If you wish to attack the Bloodbeast with your sword, type 2.
<54>
The lasso loosens itself and you are able to shake it free of the idol's neck. It falls to the floor with a loud clatter.
You quickly coil the rope up again and put it in your backpack. Wasting no more time in the cavern,
you run forward to the tunnel in the northern wall.
<55>
With lightning speed, you thrust your hand out and grip the cobra just below its open mouth.
You lift it up and, arm outstretched, dangle it in front of the Dwarf. He doesn't flinch but says in his calm expressionless way,
'Please put the cobra back in the basket and prepare for the final part of the test. Follow me.'
You do what he says and follow him back into the chamber, where Throm is pacing up and down, obviously ill at ease.
You wave to him while the Dwarf opens a second secret door and tells you to walk on through and wait for him. 
Again ou comply, and you find yourself in another circular room, although this one resembles a small arena.
The floor is covered with sand, and a small balcony runs around the arena wall. Opposite the secred door by which you entered is an ominous-looking wooden door.
Suddenly you hear a shout, and you look up to see the smiling Dwarf standing on the balcony. He throws two pieces of paper down to you.
On one of them, the words NO CROP IS are written, on the other, RUIN MOAT.
In his ever-calm voice he says, 'If you rearrange the letters of the words, you will find the names of two creatures. You may choose which one to fight in my Arena of Death.'
If you can identify the creature by rearranging the letters NO CROP IS, type it now.
If you can identify the creature by rearranging the letters RUIN MOAT, type it now.
If you cnnot identify either of the creatures, type NO.
<56>
You see that the obstruction is a large, brown, boulder-like object. You touch it with your hand and are surprised to find that it is soft and spongy.
If you wish to try to climb over it, type 1.
If you wish to slice it open with your sword, type 2.
<57>
Although you check the chest carefully for any hidden devices, you are unable to see the trap inside it.
As you lift the lid, an iron ball hanging on a cord swings back, shattering the glass capsule fined inside the lid.
A poisonous gas is instantly released into the air and you stagger back coughing and spluttering.
Lose 4 STAMINA points.
<58>
You step slowly between the poles, taking care not to touch any of them. 
Roll two dice and see if it is greater than your SKILL.
<59>
Ahead in the far distance you hear the sound of slow footsteps coming towards you. Unsure of who or what might be approaching, you look around for a place to hide.
You find a large crack in the tunnel wall which lies in shadow.
If you wish to stand your ground with your sword drawn, type 1.
If you would rather hide in the shadows, type 2.
<60>
The tunnel ends at a large oak door. Throm wastes no time in testing the handle and is somewhat surprised to find the door unlocked.
He pushes it open and walks into a torch-lit chamber. Sitting alone on an ornate chair is a DWARF, who bids you enter the chamber.
As you do so, the oak door swings shut behind you. 'Adventurers, you have done well to get this far,' says the Dwarf in a deep voice.
'However, as you both know, there can only be one winner in the Trial of Champions. As Trialmaster, it is my duty to Baron Sukumvit to let only the most able continue.
Therefore, I must devise a test of wits and streength to eliminate one of you. Please do not attempt to dispose of me.
It would be utterly pointless, for, ass you can see, there is no obvious way out of this chamber and only I know where the hidden exit lies.
Now if you would care to decide bettween you who will go first, I shall make the necessary preparations.'
You look at Throm, suddenly angry that your effective partnership might come to an end. He leans over and whispers in your ear that you should try to kill the Dwarf and worry about the exit later.
If you wish to join Throm in attacking the Dwarf, type 1.
If you would rather persuade Throm to go through with the Dwarf's test, type 2.
<61>
Despite the terible ringing sound in your ears, you hear footsteps coming down the tunnel. 
Your loud screams have attracted a tunnel guardian. Standing over you is a HOBGOBLIN. 
His face bears a sickly smile as he presses the point of his sword against your neck. 
You are unable to defend yourself and prevent the Hobgoblin from running you through.
Your adventure ends here.
<62>
The Gnome jumps in the air, yelling, 'Well done - nobody has ever managed to find all three gems before! 
Now get ready for the final test, which I will explain once and once only. 
As you can see, the lock on this door has three slots, labelled A, B and C, each of which is built to accept a specific gem. 
You have to put one of your three gems in each of the slots in the conect order. If you manage this at the first attempt, fine. 
However, if you put the gems in the wrong slots, you will be blasted by a bolt of energy from the lock, causing you injury. 
Anyway, as I said, I am allowed to help you a little. 
If you place one gem in its correct slot but get the other two wrong, I shall shout, "One crown and two skulls."
If you place all three gems incorrectly, I shall shout, "Three skulls." 
You will be allowed to try again and again until you either succeed or die. Are you ready?'
You signal your readiness with a nod of the head, and walk forward to place the three gems in the slots. 
1) Emerald		Diamond		Sapphire
2) Diamond		Sapphire	Emerald
3) Sapphire		Emerald		Diamond
4) Emerald		Sapphire	Diamond
5) Diamond		Emerald		Sapphire
6) Sapphire		Diamond		Emerald
<63>
You tie the rope around your waist and take hold of the lighted torch given to you by Throm, as your Barbarian ally calls himself.
Taking hold of the slack rope, Throm lowers you slowly over the edge of the pit and down into the dark depths below. 
You can see by the light of the torch that the sides of the pit are extremely smooth. You drop about twenty metres before hitting the bottom of the pit. 
There you see another tunnel heading north and you call up to Throm and tell him of your discovery. 
He calls back, saying that he is going to tie the rope around a protrudjng rock on the edge of the pit and will come down and join you. 
You hear him climbing down and soon you are together again. Throm retrieves his rope by shaking it off the rock, and you set off north along the new tunnel.
<64>
As soon as you put the ring on your finger, your whole body starts to shake. 
Roll two dice and see if it is greater than your SKILL.
<65>
Have you drunk a Potion found inside a black leather book?
<66>
After walking down the tunnel for a few minutes, you come to a junction. 
A white arrow painted on one wall points west. On the floor you can see wet footprints made by those who entered before you. 
It is hard to be sure, but it looks as though three of them followed the direction ofthe arrow, while one decided to go east. 
If you wish to head west, type 1. 
If you wish to head east, type 2.
<67>
You grab one of the underwater bridge pillars and cling to it, holding your breath. 
Meanwhile the Troglodytes reach the river bank and decide that you must have been swept to your death downriver
as it disappears into the depths of the mountain. 
By now your lungs are bursting for air.
TEST YOUR LUCK again!
<68>
You walk down the passage and soon find yourself standing at the edge of a deep, dark pit. 
The passage continues east on the other side of the pit. You think you could probably jump over the pit, but you are not sure. 
There is a rope hanging down from the ceiling over the centre of the pit. Will you:
Throw your shield over the pit and jump after it? Type 1.
Jump over the pit carrying all your possessions? Type 2.
Reach for the rope with your sword to enable you to swing across the pit? Type 3.
<69>
Ivy does not notice you opening the door. You slip out of her room, 
close the door quietly behind you and find yourself at the end of another tunnel. 
<70>
You just manage to dive to the side before the boulder smashes into the tunnel floor, 
splitting the stone. As you dust yourself off, you suddenly notice daylight at the end of the tunnel. 
You run forward towards a beautiful sight of blue sky and green trees. 
Running out of the tunnel, you expect to be greeted by cheering crowds, but are horrified at what you do see. 
There is no hero's welcome from the people all around you. All are dead. 
You are in fact standing in a cold chamber littered with armoured skeletons and bodies - the exit to victory was just an illusion! 
Only the corpses of past adventures are real. You run back towards the tunnel, but hit an invisible barrier. 
You are trapped and destined to end your days in the chamber of the dead.
<71>
Once again you reach for the parchment, only this time it is lying amidst a pile of broken bones. Unfolding it, you see a map of a room with a drawing of a hideous creature inside it.
Beneath the monster is a rhyme which reads:
	'Should you meet the Manticore,
	Of its tail beware.
	Shield yourself against the spikes
	Flying through the air.'
You fold up the piece of parchment and put it in your backpack. Repeating the rhyme over and over to yourself, you walk across to the alcove.
<72>
The Mirror shatters, sending fragments of glass flying everywhere.
The Mirror Demon's four faces cry out in agony, and cracks appear all over them.
THen they too shatter and fall to the floor in a pile of broken glass.
Unfortunately, you cut your sword arm badly while smashing the mirror. Although your strength is unaffected,
your weapon skill is diminished.
Lose 2 SKILL points before continuing your journey north.
<73>
If you have not done so already, 
you may walk back to search the Barbarian - type 1. 
Otherwise, leave the chamber to continue west - type 2.
<74>
The tunnel takes a sharp right turn and you find yourself in a sort of gallery lined with mirrors for some twenty metres.
A human skeleton appears to be pulled halfway through the mirror along the right-hand wall.
Suddenly a grotesque being with four arms and four screaming faces emerges from the mirror, barring your way ahead.
It walks slowly towards you, each arm outstretched to grab you.
It is a MIRROR DEMON from another dimensional plane, come to take your spirit. Will you:
Make a wish (if you are wearing a Ring of Wishes)? Type 1
Try to smash the mirrors? Type 2
Attack the Mirror Demon with your sword? Type 3
<75>
You rub the liquid into your wounds, but they do not heal. 
Staring into the empty bottle, you wonder what exactly the liquid was. 
If you have not done so already, you may open the red book - type 1.
Otherwise, you must continue north with Throm - type 2
<76>
You step round the great bulk of the dead Rock Grub and peer into the darkness of its borehole. 
You can only see a few metres, but are able to make out that it inclines slightly and is wet from the secreted slime of the Rock Grub. 
If you wish to explore the borehole, type 1. 
If you would rather walk west along the tunnel, type 2
<77>
You stagger through the open doorway into another tunnel, at the end of which is the welcome sight of daylight. 
Much to your surprise, you see the Gnome lying dead halfway down the tunnel. 
A crossbow bolt protrudes from the side of his head. 
The Gnome, in his bid for freedom, has fallen foul of Baron Sukurnvit's final trap. You walk past him and
out into brilliant sunshine.
<78>
There is an open pipe in the right-hand wall, about a metre in diameter. 
It is too dark to see far down it. You shout into it and hear your voice echoing down the iron pipe
until eventually the sound fades away.
If you wish to crawl down the pipe, type 1. 
If you would rather continue north, type 2.
<79>
You grip the arms of the chair tightly, half expecting a surge of energy or pain to rush through your body.
TEST YOUR LUCK.
<80>
You take your time and manage to step over the last pole without having touched any of them. 
You hurry on east, still following the two pairs of footprints.
<81>
The only furniture in the Goblin's room is a table, two chairs and a cupboard on the wall.
There are two closed doors, one in the west wall and the other in the north wall. Will you:
Open the cupboard? Type 1.
Open the west door? Type 2.
Open the north door? Type 3.
<82>
As the Pit Fiend slams its body against the wall, you let go of the rope and drop safely to the floor.
You run towards the double doors and are relieved to feel them swing open as you push on them.
You let them swing shut behind you and head north along the tunnel.
<83>
The passage soon leads to a junction. You notice more footprints on the floor,
possibly as many as three pairs, heading north from the south passage.
You decide to follow them.
<84>
Roll two dice and see if you get more than 8.
<85>
Before you are able to do anything else, the old man mumbles a few strange words into the air.
You feel your muscles harden and your skin go taut. 
You start to panic, but there is nothing you can do to stop the petrifaction of your body.
Your adventure ends here.
<86>
The key turns in the lock and the door opens into a four way intersection of the tunnel. 
There is nothing to be seen either to east or to west apart from the now familiar ceiling crystals 
giving off their dim light. Suddenly you hear a voice calling you, 
'This way, this way. You are on the right track.' 
It seems to be coming from somewhere directly ahead of you. 
Your curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to walk towards the beckoning voice.
<87>
The door opens into a large room.
<88>
As soon as they see you, the TROGLODYIES raise their bows and run to surround you. 
To your horror, their leader then steps forward and declares that you are their prisoner
and must subject yourself to trial by their ancient rite, the Run of the Arrow.
If you are willing to take part in the Run of the Arrow, type 1.
If you would rather try to fight your way out, type 2.
<89>
Back on solid ground once again on the cavern floor, you try to shake the rope off the idol's neck.
TEST YOUR LUCK.
<90>
As soon as you stand up, you are confronted by the most repulsive sight you have ever laid eyes on.
There in front of you, wallowing in a circular pool of fetid slime, is a bulbous creature too horrible to be believed.
Its body is green and covered all over with fearsome-looking spikes.
Its face is a mass of crimson blisters, one of which suddenly bursts to reveal yet another of its many sinister, all-seeing eyes.
A narrow path runs around the edge of the pool and leads into another tunnel in the far wall.
Have you previously read details about the loathsome BLOODBEAST in a leather-bound book?
<91>
The Orc's morning star thuds into your arm, knocking your sword to the floor. You must fight them bare-handed,
reducing your SKILL by 4 for the duration of the combat.
Fortunately, the tunnel is too narrow for both Orcs to attack you at once.
Fight them one at a time.
First ORC	Skill 5		Stamina 5
Second ORC	Skill 6		Stamina 4
<92>
Summoning all your strength, you deal the Mirror Demon one final blow with your sword. 
With an ear-splitting sound, cracks begin to run across its faces and limbs. 
Its many mouths cry out in the agony of its death throes before the Demon shatters completely and falls to the ground in a pile of tiny fragments. 
You heave a huge sigh of relief and then hurry on past.
<93>
The door opens into a small dark room, which is empty apart from a sturdy wooden chest lying on a shelf on the far wall. 
The floor is thick with dust, and you can clearly see fresh footprints leading from the door to the chest and back again. 
You wonder whether one of your rivals is still ahead of you on 'The Walk', 
or whether the chest has only recently been placed on the shelf by one of the Trialmasters.
If you wish to enter the room and open the chest, type 1.
If you would rather keep walking down the tunnel, type 2.
<94>
Taking a deep breath, you lean over the pit and plunge your forearm into the mass of wriggling worms. 
They are cold and clammy and feel extremely nasty, but at least they are harmless and you are able to seize the dagger by the hilt. 
You give it a hard tug and it comes away from the crack in which the tip was embedded. 
Admiring its beauty, and wondering whether it might once have belonged to some luckless contestant, 
you put the opal studded dagger firmlv in your belt and leave the cavern.
<95>
The iron ring is attached to a small trapdoor. 
It lifts up easily, and inside a small compartment you find a finely crafted shield made of the purest iron.
Marvelling at its splendour,you strap it on to your arm. 
Add 1 SKILL point. 
You walk towards the double doors and push them open.
<96>
Your second blow also fails to smash the mirror. 
The Mirror Demon reaches out, grabs your wrist and starts pulling you towards the mirror. 
Its strength is incredible, and, despite all your efforts, you cannot resist. 
With every second you come closer to the mirror. 
When the Mirror Demon touches the mirror, it seems to disappear straight through it. 
With horror you see your own arm disappear through the mirror too, and the rest of your body soon follows.
You are now in a mirror world of another dimension, from which you can never return.
<97>
Unknown to you, the Bloodbeast has only one weakness: its real eyes. 
More by chance than by design, you plunge your blade deep into one of them, and the Bloodbeast immediately slumps back into its pool. 
After a few massive convulsions, it sinks beneath the oily surface of the pool.
Not waiting to see whether it will recover, you run into the tunnel, anxious to get away from the Bloodbeast's toxic chamber as fast as possible.
<98>
Lifting the goblet releases a sprung catch, and a dart shoots out of the wooden table leg.
TEST YOUR LUCK
<99>
Smiling, you tell Ivy that you think she and Sourbelly look very alike.
Then, while she stares admiringly at the painting, you pick up a broken stool, creep up behind her
and smash her over the back of the head with it as hard as you can.
To your immense relief, she slumps unconscious to the floor.
If you wish to search her room, type 1.
If not, leave by the door in the east wall. You find yourself standing at the end of a tunnel. Type 2.
<100>
Only a few metres further down the passage, you see another closed door in the left-hand wall.
The letter X is scratched into its centre panel. Putting your ear to the door, you listen intently but can hear nothing.
If you wish to open the door, type 1.
If you would rather keep walking north, type 2.
<101>
The river current is quite strong and, encumbered by your armour and backpack, you are unable to swim against it. 
Within seconds you are swept under the bridge.
Standing on the river bank, the Troglodytes look on laughing and jeering 
as you drift to your death down-river in the depths of the mountain.
<102>
You enter a room which is small and completely empty.
As soon as you are inside, the door slams shut behind you.
Suddenly a voice booms out of nowhere, shouting,
'Welcome to Deathtrap Dungeon, the ingenious killer labyrinth of my master.
Adventurer, I trust you will pay your respects to my master by shouting out his name?'
Will you shout:
Hail, Sukumvit? Type 1.
Sukumvit is a worm? Type 2.
<103>
You breathe in the poisonous gas and start to choke.
Lose 3 STAMINA points.
<104>
Reacting quickly, you manage to jump over the outstretched tongue and run into the tunnel,
leaving the Bloodbeast wallowing in its pool to await another victim.
<105>
Your reflexes are sharp and you quickly jump aside.
The dart whistles past, only just missing you, and thuds into the opposite wall. 
You see the goblet lying on the floor and the red liquid running away in rivulets over the grey stone. 
At least the goblet may be of use, so you put it in your backpack.
If you have not done so already, you may walk back to search the Barbarian. Type 1.
Otherwise, leave the chamber to continue west. Type 2.
<106>
Squeezing the arm of the chair triggers a secret panel which springs into the air.
You find a glass phial lying in a cavity. 
You pick it up and read the label:
'Doppelganger Potion - one dose only.
This liquid will make your body take on the shape of any nearby being.'
You place the strange potion in your backpack and continue north.
<107>
You come to an arched doorway set in the right-hand wall of the tunnel.
The heavy stone door is closed, but there is an iron latch and a round handle.
If you wish to try the door, type 1.
If instead you wish to continue along the tunnel, type 2.
<108>
There is a large panel of glass in the left-hand wall of the tunnel. 
Through it you can see a bright, torch-lit room teeming with GIANT INSECTS of every possible description. 
Bees, wasps, beetles, ticks - even the mites are over six centimetres long. 
The noise is threatening. In the middle of the room, a jewelled crown lies on top of a small table. 
What looks like a large diamond is set in the middle of the crown.
Will you:
Break the glass and try to snatch the crown? Type 1.
Continue west? Type 2.
Return to the junction to head north? Type 3.
<109>
You arrive at another junction in the tunnel.
If you wish to keep heading west, type 1.
If you wish to go north, type 2.
<110>
The tunnel soon takes another sharp right turn.
Following it east, you arrive at a strange obstruction: a line of twelve wooden poles across the tunnel.
They are fixed to the walls about half a metre off the floor and spaced a metre apart.
If you wish to step between the poles, type 1.
If you wish to walk across the top of the poles, type 2.
<111>
You wipe the vile yellow slime from the blade of your sword and walk quickly to the door, back into the tunnel and head north.
<112>
Apart from two portions of your Provisions which were saturated and are now inedible, all your other possessions remain intact.
You repack them carefully inside your backpack and set off north again.
<113>
The wooden ball whistles past the skull, hitting the far wall with a loud 'crack'.
If you wish to try again with the other ball, type 1.
If you have already thrown twice, or do not wish to throw again, you may decide to close the door and continue west along the tunnel.
Type 2.
<114>
The Caveman is wearing a leather wristband with four small rats' skulls hanging from it.
If you wish to put it on your own wrist, type 1.
If you would rather set off north again, type 2.
<115>
Your body continues to vibrate intensely and you feel as if you are about to pass out. 
But your strength is great, and you manage to withstand the tremendous shock to your system. 
Finally you calm down and begin to feel the ring's beneficial powers working on you. 
Add 3 STAMINA points. 
You see Throm looking at you anxiously, so you reassure him that you are fully recovered. 
He strides off east and you follow him eagerly.
<116>
You cannot believe that the Bloodbeast is unaffected by its new wound. 
You hesitate a moment too long and it lunges forward, cracking your skull with its jaws. 
Then it drags you into its pool, where you will be predigested and later consumed by the hideous creature.
<117>
After a long walk down the tunnel, you come to a dead end.
A large mirror reaching from the ceiling to the floor hangs on the end wall, and in the dim light you can just about make out your own reflection.
If you wish to take a closer look in the mirror, type 1.
If you would rather make the long walk back to the last junction in the tunnel in order to head east, type 2.
<118>
Despite the stalactites crashing all around, you manage to dash through the archway without injury.
You look round and see Throm thundering towards you, one arm held over his head for protction.
He dashes into the tunnel and leans against the cold wall, panting heavily. 
He apologizes for starting the rock-fall and offers you his hand to shake.
You tell Throm that maybe he should use sign language in future, even for laughing!
You both smile and head east once more.
<119>
Ahead you can see a large obstruction on the tunnel floor, although it is too dark to make out exactly what it is.
The wet footprints you have been following carry on towards the obstruction.
If you want to continue east, type 1.
If you would rather go back to the junction and head west, type 2.
<120>
Lying in a hole about a metre deep, you see a grappling iron and a leather pouch. 
If you wish to reach down for them, type 1.
If you would rather ignore them and continue north, type 2.
<121>
The Dwarf looks at the dice. 'Not very good at playing the odds, are you?'he sneers. 
'I regret you must suffer a penalty before you can continue.'
From out of his pocket he produces two pills.
One is stamped with the letter S and the other stamped with the letter L. 
He asks you to choose one and swallow it.
If you wish to swallow the pill stamped with the letter S, type 1.
If you wish to swallow the other pill, type 2.
<122>

or the right-hand flight of steps (Type 2).
<123>
The necklace is an amulet of strength.

<124>
You throw the trapdoor open and run up the steps into a bright, lantern-lit room. 
Two GOBLINS are sharpening their short swords on a stone set in the middle of the floor. 
You catch them momentarily off guard, but they quickly recover and both rush forward to attack you.

<125>
You tiptoe towards the door while Ivy prattles on.
TEST YOUR LUCK.
<126>
The pouch on the Barabarian's belt is empty apart from some strange-looking dried meat wrapped in a cloth.
Will you:
Eat the dried meat? Type 1.
Leave the meat and walk over to the alcove (if you have not done so already?) Type 2
Leave the chamber and head west? Type 3.
<127>
The only possible way out of the hall as far as you can see is by using the chute in the northern wall.
You decide to give it a go and climb into the chute.
You slide gently down and emerge into another room, landing on your back.
<128>
At the back of the alcove are some steps leading down into a cellar. 
Cobwebs brush your face as you descend. 
The cellar ceiling is quite low, and the floor is strewn with rubbish and debris. 
In the middle of the wall opposite you is an archway which leads into another crystal lit tunnel. 
There are large mushrooms growing on the rubbish to your right. 
If you wish to step through the archway, type 1. 
If you wish to stop to eat some of the mushrooms,type 2.
<129>
You tie the rope to the grappling iron and hurl it over the top of the wall. 
Its hooks dig into the stone and you begin to haul yourself up. 
Peering over the top of the wall, you see an enormous dinosaur-like monster thrashing about in a sand-covered pit. 
Its tough hide is a mottled green colour, and it stands some ten metres tall on its muscular hind legs. 
Rows of razor-sharp teeth line its gigantic jaws, which open and close with bone-snapping power.
There is a large double door in the wall on the far side of the pit, which appears 
to be the only way out of this section of the dungeon.
Will you:
Lower yourself down on the rope into the pit to fight the PIT FIEND? Type 1
Throw your bone monkey charm into the pit (if you have one)? Type 2
Try to hook the PIT FIEND with the grappling iron while sitting on top of the wall? Type 3.

First HOBGOBLIN		Skill: 7	Stamina: 5
Second HOBGOBLIN	Skill: 6	Stamina: 5
<131>
The crossbow bolts fly over your head and thud into the opposite wall; 
fortunately, you are still crouching on the floor. 
Now that the trap has been sprung, you can leave the room by the door through 
which you entered. Back in the tunnel you head on west.
<132>
You just have time to hear the Gnome say, 'One crown and two skulls', 
before a white bolt of energy shoots out from the lock into your chest and knocks you unconscious. 
Roll one die, add 1 to the number and reduce your STAMINA by the total.
If you are still alive, you come to and are told by the Gnome to try again. 
You know you placed one gem in the correct slot, but which one? 
You sigh and tentatively try a new combination.
1) Emerald		Diamond		Sapphire
2) Diamond		Sapphire	Emerald
3) Sapphire		Emerald		Diamond
4) Emerald		Sapphire	Diamond
5) Diamond		Emerald		Sapphire
6) Sapphire		Diamond		Emerald
<133>
Once again, the mysterious voice calls out, only this time its tone is full of contempt and derision.
'So, we have a snivelling weed in our midst, do we?' sneers the voice.
'My master has a special gift for you, loathsome creep.'
Suddenly water starts pouring into the room through a hole in the ceiling.
It soon rises above your ankles, and there is no apparent way of escape.
You wade back to the door. It is firmly locked, but in desperation you try ramming it with your shoulder.
Roll two dice and see if it is greater than your SKILL.
<134>
The tunnel leads into a large room, its ceiling supported by several marble pillars.
As you enter the room, you suddenly see a strange beast to your right.
It has the body of a lion with dragon-like wings attached to it, but its head is like that of an old bearded man.
Have you read the poem written on the Skeleton Warrior's parchment?
<135>
Passing the Rock Grub's borehole on your left, you soon arrive at the junction.
You take a quick look down the tunnel leading south, but do not see anybody approaching.
Quickening your step, you hurry on east.
<136>
The door opens into another tunnel, which rises gently into the distance. 
After walking uphill for a while, the tunnel levels out and you soon arrive at a door in the right hand wall, 
to which a withered hand is nailed.
If you wish to open the door, type 1.
If you would rather continue north, type 2.
<137>
Walking along the tunnel, you are surprised to see a large iron bell hanging down from the ceiling. 
If you wish to ring the bell, type 1.
If you would rather walk around it and continue west, type 2.
<138>
The books pages are sealed together, but a small hole has been cut out in the middle of them, 
just large enough to hold a small corked bottle containing a clear liquid. 
You show it to Throm, who holds up his hand, indicating that he does not want you to come anywhere near him with it; 
his distrust of things unknown is strongly evident. Will you:
Drink the liquid? Type 1
Rub the liquid into your wounds? Type 2
Open the red book (if you have not done so already)? Type 3
Leave the bottle and book to continue north with Throm? Type 4
<139>

She is angry and attacks you ferociously.
Lose 2 STAMINA points.
If you are still alive, you manage to draw your sword and fight back.
IVY		Skill: 9	Stamina: 9
<140>
You try to force the point of your sword under the emerald eye. Much to your surprise, it shatters on contact, releasing a jet of poisonous gas straight into your face.
The gas knocks you out and you fall backwards, bouncing down the idol to land on the floor.
Your adventure ends here.
<141>
The Mirror Demon is almost on top of you when, summoning all your strength,
you strike one final blow against the mirror with your sword.
Roll two dice and see if the total is greater than your SKILL.
<142>
There is a new branch in the tunnel on your left, and ahead you see two bodies lying on the floor.
You stop and peer down the new tunnel, but seeing no doors or creatures you decide against walking down it.
With your sword drawn, you walk over to where the bodies lie.
<143>
You call out to the Dwarf telling him to send in the SCORPION because you are ready to fight. 
Slowly the wooden door rises, and a huge, grotesque black Scorpion squeezes underneath it and enters the room. 
You draw your sword in readiness and prepare to fight the sinister creature with its huge pincers and deadly sting
GIANT SCORPION	Skill 10	Stamina 10

The Scorpion attacks you with both pincers, and you must treat each pincer as a separate creature as though you were fighting two creatures.
Both pincers have a SKILL of 10 and will attack you separately in each Attack Round, but you must choose which of the two you will fight.
Attack one pincer as in a normal battle.
Against the other pincer, you will not wound it but you might fend off its blow.
<144>
Still smiling, the old man looks at you and says quietly, 'Wrong'.
<145>
The Dwarf is expecting your move. Furthermore, you are not as fast as you should be because of your recent ordeal, 
so he easily evades your punch, saying 'I could kill you now if I wished, but I yearn for a hand-to-hand fight.'
Then he throws down his crossbow and draws an axe from his belt. 
Despite your fatigue, you think only of vengeance.
DWARF	Skill: 8	Stamina: 6
During each Attack Round, your Attack Strength will be reduced by 2 because of your condition.
<146>
The pain in your lungs forces you to rise to the surface for air. 
Fortunately none of the Troglodytes see you and they all disperse. 
You climb out of the river and cross the bridge to the northern bank. 
Any remaining Provisions you may have are now inedible.
You continue to walk through the vast cavern until at last you see a tunnel in the far wall. 
You walk down it until you come to a heavy wooden door which is locked. 
Do you have an iron key?
<147>
The water in the bamboo pipe is welcomingly refreshing.
Add 1 Stamina point.
It also contains a magical solution which will enable you to be exposed to melting-point temperatures without harm.
Discarding the bamboo, you start off north again in good spirits.
<148>
There is nowhere to go except down the steps towards the barking dogs.

Second GUARD DOG	Skill: 7	Stamina: 8
You may Escape after killing the first Guard Dog by running east down the tunnel.

You let go of the rope and hear it fall to the bottom of the pit.
The Barbarian curses, promising to kill you if your paths should cross again.
You step back and take a running jump.
You land safely on the far side of the pit and continue west.
Further down the tunnel, you step on a floor stone which tilts forward,
triggering a trap which releases a boulder loosely set in the ceiling.
You look up just as it is about to crash on top of you.
TEST YOUR LUCK
<150>
Having had the sense not to put your sword arm into the hole, the effects of the tentacled arm are not too serious.

The Dwarf congratulates you for guessing correctly.
He tells you that you must now progress to the second stage of the test. 
He reaches for a wicker basket and tells you that a snake is held within it. 
He tips up the basket and the snake drops on to the floor; 
it is a cobra, and it rears up in the air ready to strike. 
The Dwarf tells you that he wishes to test your reactions. 
Bare-handed, you must grasp the cobra below its head, avoiding its deadly fangs. 
You crouch down on the floor, tensing yourself for the moment to seize it. 
Roll two dice and see if the total is greater than your SKILL.
<153>
The door opens into a small room in which there is a human skull with jewelled eyes resting on top of a marble plinth.

Walk into the room and pick up the skull? Type 1
Throw a wooden ball at the skull from the doorway? Type 2.
Close the door and continue west, taking the wooden balls with you? Type 3

He nods his head in silent understanding and sets off towards the west with you at his side.
<155>
The words of her poem flash through your mind:
'When corridor doth water meet, do not make a quick retreat. . .'

Now you must decide what to do. 
If you wish to dive into the water, type 1.

You have swallowed acid!
Lose 1 SKILL point and 4 STAMINA points.

Your reactions are still slow because of the poison in your system, and although you try to jump over the outstretched tongue, your legs let you down.
The sticky tongue wraps itself around your leg, flipping you over, and starts to pull you towards the pool.
Your sword has slipped out of your hand and you start to panic.
Do you have a dagger?
<160>
Your armour and sword weigh you down, but you just manage to land safely on the far edge of the pit.
You waste no time and head east.
<161>
You push past the two Leprechauns and head off north, the noise of jeering and laughter ringing in your ears.

If you had any gems, they are now gone, the Leprechaun who landed on your back stole them from your backpack.
You curse the thieving Leprechauns and set off north again.
<162>
Removing the box lid by the light of the tunnel, you find an iron key and a large gem. It is a sapphire.
Add 1 Luck point.

The dwarf calls down from the balcony, congratulating you on your victory. 
He throws a sack down into the arena and tells you to relax and regain your strength for the final part of the test.
Then he walks off, saying he will return in about ten minutes.
You open the sack and find a jug of wine and a cooked chicken.
If you wish to eat and drink the Dwarf's offerings, type 1.
If you would rather just sit down and await his return, type 2.
<164>
As you walk along, droplets of water again start falling from the tunnel ceiling.

If you wish to open the door, type 1.

Still holding the rope, you are pulled off the wall and tumble to the bottom of the pit.
Lose 4 STAMINA points.
<168>
Lifting the latch and pushing the heavy stone door open, you find yourself in a large cavern. 
The light is dim and murky, but as your eyes begin to adjust, you see that the walls are covered in green algae and running with moisture. 
The floor is strewn with straw. The atmosphere is warm, damp and fetid, and a soft humming sound fills the air. 
You step gingerly through the straw towards a corner of the cavern, where there appears to be a shallow pit.
Peering warily into the pit, you are disgusted to see a mass of pale writhing worms, some as much as half a metre long. 
Utterly nauseated, you are about to turn away when you notice that their undulating bodies are swarming round a dagger, 
its point held fast in a crack in the pit floor. 
The hilt is cased in black leather studded with opals, and the blade is fashioned from a strange reddish-black burnished metal you have never seen before. 
You long to touch the dagger, but this would mean plunging your hand in among the writhing worms.
Do you reach for the dagger? Type 1
Or back away in disgust and leave the cavern? Type 2.
